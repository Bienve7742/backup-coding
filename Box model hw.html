Science is the study of the world around us, helping us understand how things work and why they happen. From the tiniest
atoms to the vastness of space, science explores every corner of the universe with curiosity and careful observation. It
combines questioning, experimenting, and discovering to uncover truths that shape technology, medicine, and our daily
lives. Without science, we would not have electricity, vaccines, or even the ability to explore the stars. At its heart,
science is about asking questions and seeking answers, turning simple wonder into powerful knowledge.

        Science covers a wide range of topics that help us understand the world and beyond. Physics explores forces, motion,
        energy, and the laws that keep the universe in balance. Chemistry studies elements, reactions, and the materials that
        make up everything around us. Biology focuses on living things, from tiny cells and bacteria to complex ecosystems and
        human anatomy. Astronomy looks outward, investigating stars, planets, galaxies, and the mysteries of space. Earth
        science examines our planet, including weather, rocks, oceans, and natural disasters. Together, these fields of science
        connect to explain both the smallest particles and the largest cosmic structures.
